## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server for fast hot module replacement
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling with custom hospital theme colors
- **shadcn/ui** component library built on Radix UI primitives for accessible UI components
- **TanStack Query** (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation for form handling

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript for API endpoints
- **RESTful API design** with organized route handlers

- **Role-based access control** (admin/viewer permissions)
- **Middleware pattern** for request logging and error handling

### Data Layer
- **MongoDB** database for flexible document-based storage with fallback to in-memory storage
- **Mongoose ODM** for schema modeling and database operations
- **Database collections** include users, residents, faculty, forms, disciplinary actions, rewards, and sessions
- **Schema validation** using Zod for runtime type checking
- **Document-based data modeling** with embedded and referenced relationships
